# SCION
Spatial Continuous Integration - Earth Evolution Model

SCION is a global climate-biogeochemical model that runs over geological timescales. It runs forwards in time and computes the Earthâ€™s major elemental cycles and surface climate. It also predicts the values of a suite of geochemical tracers to aid in hypothesis testing. 

Requies MATLAB. 

For more informaiton on running the model see the Guidebook. For scientific derivaiton see the journal articles listed in the Guidebook.

This code is free to use. The model is under continual revision/extension by my research group and collaborators. For any queries or collaboration ideas please email b.mills@leeds.ac.uk
